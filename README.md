# lettercounter

Welcome to my improved vowel counter, but with more characters!

This program is executed in the command line. The user enters the program name and a file name of their choosing.
The program runs through the file and check for certain characters, including vowels both uppercase and lowercase and adds them up. It
then outputs the totals for each letter and the total of all letters.
